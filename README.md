# SendEventEmailsProjectDA
Django App to send mails to employees.
Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) to deliver emails to their end users. SMTP also retrieves messages, though that has not been its primary use case. Open source frameworks like Django, a Python-based web framework, allows more control for sending emails using functions and expressions.
Application contains both modules i.e. for single recepient and for multiple recepients. 
Need to add/customize hosts server, email id and password in settings.py
For sending mail to multiple recepients/employees at a time, need to add multiple email id's by keeping spaces between them.
